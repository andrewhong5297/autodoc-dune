  "summary": "This code is the main entry point for the Autodoc CLI tool, which provides a set of commands to help developers automatically generate documentation for their codebase. The tool uses the `commander` library to define and handle commands, and `inquirer` for interactive prompts.\n\nThe available commands are:\n\n1. `init`: Initializes the repository by creating an `autodoc.config.json` file in the current directory. If the file already exists, it uses the existing configuration.\n   ```bash\n   autodoc init\n   ```\n\n2. `estimate`: Estimates the cost of running the `index` command on the repository. It requires the `autodoc.config.json` file to be present.\n   ```bash\n   autodoc estimate\n   ```\n\n3. `index`: Traverses the codebase, writes documentation using LLM, and creates a locally stored index. Before starting the indexing process, it prompts the user for confirmation. It requires the `autodoc.config.json` file to be present.\n   ```bash\n   autodoc index\n   ```\n\n4. `user`: Sets the Autodoc user configuration. If a user configuration file exists, it uses the existing configuration.\n   ```bash\n   autodoc user\n   ```\n\n5. `q`: Queries an Autodoc index. It requires both the `autodoc.config.json` and user configuration files to be present.\n   ```bash\n   autodoc q\n   ```\n\nThe code also listens for unhandled promise rejections and handles them gracefully by showing an error spinner, stopping the spinner, and exiting with an error code.\n\nIn the larger project, this CLI tool serves as the primary interface for users to interact with Autodoc, allowing them to easily generate and manage documentation for their codebase.",
  "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of the Autodoc CLI Tool?**\n\n   The Autodoc CLI Tool is designed to help developers automatically generate documentation for their codebase by traversing the code, writing docs via LLM, and creating a locally stored index.\n\n2. **How does the `estimate` command work and what does it return?**\n\n   The `estimate` command reads the `autodoc.config.json` file and estimates the cost of running the `index` command on the repository. It provides an estimation of the resources required to generate the documentation.\n\n3. **What is the role of the `user` command and how does it interact with the user configuration file?**\n\n   The `user` command is responsible for setting the Autodoc user configuration. It reads the user configuration file (if it exists) and allows the user to update or create a new configuration. This configuration is then used in other commands, such as the `query` command, to interact with the Autodoc index.",
