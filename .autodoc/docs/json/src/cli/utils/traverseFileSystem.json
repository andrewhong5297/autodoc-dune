  "summary": "The `traverseFileSystem` function in this code is an asynchronous function that recursively traverses a given file system, processes folders and files, and filters out ignored files based on provided patterns. It is designed to be used in the larger project for processing and generating documentation for a given project.\n\nThe function takes an object of type `TraverseFileSystemParams` as its input, which contains the following properties:\n\n- `inputPath`: The root folder path to start traversing.\n- `projectName`: The name of the project being documented.\n- `processFile`: An optional callback function to process files.\n- `processFolder`: An optional callback function to process folders.\n- `ignore`: An array of patterns to ignore files and folders.\n- `filePrompt`: An optional prompt for processing files.\n- `folderPrompt`: An optional prompt for processing folders.\n- `contentType`: The type of content being processed.\n- `targetAudience`: The target audience for the documentation.\n- `linkHosted`: A flag indicating if the documentation should be linked to a hosted version.\n\nThe function first checks if the provided `inputPath` exists. If not, it logs an error message and returns. It then defines a helper function `shouldIgnore` that checks if a given file or folder should be ignored based on the `ignore` patterns.\n\nThe main logic of the function is implemented in the `dfs` (depth-first search) function, which recursively traverses the file system. It reads the contents of the current folder, filters out ignored files and folders, and processes them accordingly. If an entry is a directory, it calls `dfs` recursively and then calls the `processFolder` callback if provided. If an entry is a file and is a text file, it calls the `processFile` callback if provided.\n\nHere's an example of how this function might be used in the larger project:\n\n```javascript\nimport { traverseFileSystem } from './autodoc';\n\nconst params = {\n  inputPath: './myProject',\n  projectName: 'My Project',\n  ignore: ['node_modules/**', '.git/**'],\n  processFile: async (fileInfo) => {\n    // Process the file, e.g., generate documentation\n  },\n  processFolder: async (folderInfo) => {\n    // Process the folder, e.g., create a folder in the output directory\n  },\n};\n\ntraverseFileSystem(params);\n```\n\nThis example would traverse the `myProject` folder, ignoring any files and folders within `node_modules` and `.git`, and process the remaining files and folders using the provided callback functions.",
  "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of the `traverseFileSystem` function?**\n\n   The `traverseFileSystem` function is an asynchronous function that traverses a given file system, processes files and folders based on the provided parameters, and ignores files and folders that match the specified ignore patterns.\n\n2. **How does the `shouldIgnore` function work?**\n\n   The `shouldIgnore` function takes a file or folder name as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the file or folder should be ignored based on the provided ignore patterns. It uses the `minimatch` library to check if the file or folder name matches any of the ignore patterns.\n\n3. **What is the role of the `dfs` function inside `traverseFileSystem`?**\n\n   The `dfs` function is an asynchronous function that performs a depth-first search on the file system starting from the given `currentPath`. It processes folders and files based on the provided parameters and recursively calls itself for each subdirectory."
