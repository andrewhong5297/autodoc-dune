  "summary": "The `traverseFileSystem` function in this code is an asynchronous function that recursively traverses a given file system, processing files and folders based on the provided parameters. It is designed to be used in the larger project for generating documentation or performing other tasks that require processing files and folders in a directory structure.\n\nThe function takes an object of type `TraverseFileSystemParams` as its input, which contains various properties to control the traversal and processing behavior. These properties include:\n\n- `inputPath`: The root path to start the traversal from.\n- `projectName`: The name of the project being processed.\n- `processFile`: An optional callback function to process a file.\n- `processFolder`: An optional callback function to process a folder.\n- `ignore`: An array of patterns to ignore during traversal.\n- `filePrompt`, `folderPrompt`: Optional prompts for user interaction.\n- `contentType`, `targetAudience`, `linkHosted`: Additional metadata for processing.\n\nThe function first checks if the provided `inputPath` exists using `fs.access`. If the path does not exist, it logs an error message and returns. It then defines a helper function `shouldIgnore` that checks if a given file or folder should be ignored based on the `ignore` patterns.\n\nThe main logic of the function is implemented in the `dfs` (depth-first search) function, which is called recursively to traverse the file system. It reads the contents of the current directory using `fs.readdir`, filters out ignored items, and processes the remaining items.\n\nFor each item, if it is a directory, the `dfs` function is called recursively, and the `processFolder` callback is invoked if provided. If it is a file and its content is text (checked using `isText`), the `processFile` callback is invoked if provided.\n\nThe traversal is performed using `Promise.all` to process items concurrently, improving performance. If an error occurs during traversal, it is logged and rethrown.\n\nHere's an example of how this function might be used in the larger project:\n\n```javascript\nawait traverseFileSystem({\n  inputPath: './src',\n  projectName: 'myProject',\n  processFile: (params) => {\n    // Process file logic here\n  },\n  processFolder: (params) => {\n    // Process folder logic here\n  },\n  ignore: ['node_modules/**', '.git/**'],\n});\n```",
  "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of the `traverseFileSystem` function?**\n\n   The `traverseFileSystem` function is an asynchronous function that traverses a given file system, processes folders and files based on the provided parameters, and ignores files and folders based on the given ignore patterns.\n\n2. **How does the `shouldIgnore` function work?**\n\n   The `shouldIgnore` function takes a file name as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the file should be ignored or not. It checks if the file name matches any of the ignore patterns provided in the `ignore` parameter using the `minimatch` library.\n\n3. **What is the role of the `dfs` function inside `traverseFileSystem`?**\n\n   The `dfs` function is an asynchronous function that performs a depth-first search on the file system starting from the given `currentPath`. It processes folders and files based on the provided parameters and recursively calls itself for each subdirectory found.",
