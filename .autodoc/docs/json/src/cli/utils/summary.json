      "summary": "The `APIRateLimit` class in this code snippet is designed to manage and limit the number of concurrent API calls made by the application. This is useful in situations where the API being called has a rate limit or when the application needs to prevent overwhelming the server with too many requests at once.\n\nThe class constructor takes an optional parameter `maxConcurrentCalls`, which defaults to 50, to set the maximum number of concurrent API calls allowed. It maintains a queue of API calls and keeps track of the number of calls in progress.\n\nThe main method of this class is `callApi<T>(apiFunction: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T>`. It takes a function `apiFunction` that returns a promise and wraps it in a new promise. The purpose of this wrapping is to control the execution of the API calls and ensure that they do not exceed the specified rate limit.\n\nWhen `callApi` is called, the provided `apiFunction` is added to the queue and the `dequeueAndExecute` method is triggered if there are available slots for concurrent calls. The `dequeueAndExecute` method checks if there are any API calls in the queue and if the number of in-progress calls is below the maximum limit. If both conditions are met, it dequeues the next API call and executes it.\n\nThe `executeCall` function inside `callApi` is responsible for actually calling the API function, resolving or rejecting the promise based on the result, and updating the number of in-progress calls. Once an API call is completed, the `dequeueAndExecute` method is called again to process any remaining calls in the queue.\n\nHere's an example of how this class can be used in the larger project:\n\n```javascript\nconst apiRateLimiter = new APIRateLimit(10); // Limit to 10 concurrent calls\n\nasync function fetchSomeData(id) {\n  // Call the API using the rate limiter\n  const result = await apiRateLimiter.callApi(() => fetch(`https://api.example.com/data/${id}`));\n  return result;\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `APIRateLimit` class is used to limit the number of concurrent calls to the `fetch` function, ensuring that no more than 10 calls are made at once.",

It adds the API call to a queue and executes it when there are available slots for concurrent calls. The method returns a Promise of type `T`, where `T` is the expected return type of the `apiFunction`.\n\n3. **How can the maximum number of concurrent calls be configured?**\n\n   The maximum number of concurrent calls can be configured by passing a value to the `maxConcurrentCalls` parameter in the constructor of the `APIRateLimit` class. If no value is provided, the default value is set to 50.",

The main purpose of these functions is to generate file names and GitHub URLs for documentation files.\n\n1. `getFileName(input, delimiter, extension)`: This function takes an input string, an optional delimiter (default is '.'), and an optional extension (default is '.md'). It returns a new string with the given extension. If the delimiter is found in the input string, the function removes the part of the string after the last occurrence of the delimiter and appends the extension. If the delimiter is not found, the function simply appends the extension to the input string. This function can be used to generate file names for documentation files with the desired extension.\n\n   Example usage:\n\n   ```\n   getFileName('example.txt'); // returns 'example.md'\n   getFileName('example', '_', '.html'); // returns 'example.html'\n   ```\n\n2. `githubFileUrl(githubRoot, inputRoot, filePath, linkHosted)`: This function generates a GitHub URL for a file. It takes the GitHub repository root URL, the input root folder path, the file path, and a boolean flag indicating whether the URL should be for the hosted version of the file or the source code. It returns a string with the generated URL.\n\n   Example usage:\n\n   ```\n   githubFileUrl('https://github.com/user/repo', '/input', '/input/example.md', true);\n   // returns 'https://github.com/user/repo/example.md'\n   ```\n\n3. `githubFolderUrl(githubRoot, inputRoot, folderPath, linkHosted)`: This function is similar to `githubFileUrl`, but it generates a GitHub URL for a folder instead of a file. It takes the same arguments as `githubFileUrl` and returns a string with the generated URL.\n\n   Example usage:\n\n   ```\n   githubFolderUrl('https://github.com/user/repo', '/input', '/input/folder', true);\n   // returns 'https://github.com/user/repo/folder'\n   ```\n\nThese utility functions can be used throughout the autodoc project to generate file names and GitHub URLs for documentation files and folders, ensuring consistent naming and URL generation across the project.",

If the delimiter is found, the input string is sliced up to the last delimiter index and the extension is appended.\n\n2. **What are the differences between the `githubFileUrl` and `githubFolderUrl` functions?**\n\n   Both functions take the same parameters: `githubRoot`, `inputRoot`, a path (either `filePath` or `folderPath`), and a `linkHosted` boolean. The main difference is in the returned URL: `githubFileUrl` returns a URL pointing to a file in the GitHub repository, while `githubFolderUrl` returns a URL pointing to a folder in the GitHub repository. The URL structure differs slightly, with `/blob/master/` for files and `/tree/master/` for folders.\n\n3. **What is the purpose of the `linkHosted` parameter in the `githubFileUrl` and `githubFolderUrl` functions?**\n\n   The `linkHosted` parameter is a boolean that determines whether the returned URL should point to the hosted version of the file or folder on GitHub Pages (if `true`) or to the file or folder within the GitHub repository itself (if `false`). Depending on the value of `linkHosted`, the functions will return different URL structures.",

It imports the `OpenAIChat` class from the `langchain/llms` module and the `LLMModelDetails` and `LLMModels` types from the `../../types.js` file.\n\nThe `models` object contains three LLMs: GPT3, GPT4, and GPT432k. Each model has its own properties, such as `name`, `inputCostPer1KTokens`, `outputCostPer1KTokens`, `maxLength`, and an instance of the `OpenAIChat` class with the respective model name and API key. Additionally, each model has counters for input tokens, output tokens, succeeded, failed, and total files processed.\n\nThe `printModelDetails` function takes an array of `LLMModelDetails` and prints a summary table to the console. It calculates the total cost for each model based on the input and output tokens and their respective costs per 1,000 tokens. It also calculates the total file count, succeeded, failed, tokens, and cost across all models.\n\nThe `totalIndexCostEstimate` function calculates the total cost of indexing all models in the input array. It uses the same cost calculation as in `printModelDetails` but returns the total cost as a number.\n\nThese functions can be used in the larger project to manage and analyze the usage and costs of different LLMs. For example, the `printModelDetails` function can be called to display a summary of the models' usage and costs:\n\n```javascript\nimport { models, printModelDetails } from './path/to/this/file';\n\n// Process files with models...\n// Update models' properties...\n\nprintModelDetails(Object.values(models));\n```\n\nAnd the `totalIndexCostEstimate` function can be used to estimate the total cost of indexing all models:\n\n```javascript\nimport { models, totalIndexCostEstimate } from './path/to/this/file';\n\n// Process files with models...\n// Update models' properties...\n\nconst totalCost = totalIndexCostEstimate(Object.values(models));\nconsole.log(`Total cost: ${totalCost}`);\n```",

      "summary": "The `traverseFileSystem` function in this code is an asynchronous function that recursively traverses a given file system, processing files and folders based on the provided parameters. It is designed to be used in the larger project for generating documentation or performing other tasks that require processing files and folders in a directory structure.\n\nThe function takes an object of type `TraverseFileSystemParams` as its input, which contains various properties to control the traversal and processing behavior. These properties include:\n\n- `inputPath`: The root path to start the traversal from.\n- `projectName`: The name of the project being processed.\n- `processFile`: An optional callback function to process a file.\n- `processFolder`: An optional callback function to process a folder.\n- `ignore`: An array of patterns to ignore during traversal.\n- `filePrompt`, `folderPrompt`: Optional prompts for user interaction.\n- `contentType`, `targetAudience`, `linkHosted`: Additional metadata for processing.\n\nThe function first checks if the provided `inputPath` exists using `fs.access`. If the path does not exist, it logs an error message and returns. It then defines a helper function `shouldIgnore` that checks if a given file or folder should be ignored based on the `ignore` patterns.\n\nThe main logic of the function is implemented in the `dfs` (depth-first search) function, which is called recursively to traverse the file system. It reads the contents of the current directory using `fs.readdir`, filters out ignored items, and processes the remaining items.\n\nFor each item, if it is a directory, the `dfs` function is called recursively, and the `processFolder` callback is invoked if provided. If it is a file and its content is text (checked using `isText`), the `processFile` callback is invoked if provided.\n\nThe traversal is performed using `Promise.all` to process items concurrently, improving performance.

It returns a `Promise` that resolves with the provided `value` after the specified `timeoutMs` has elapsed.

It returns a `Promise` that resolves with `true` when the provided function `fn` returns `true`. The function `fn` is checked every 50 milliseconds, up to a maximum of 200 times (i.e., 10 seconds). If `fn` does not return `true` within this time, the `Promise` is rejected.\n\nThis function can be used to wait for a specific condition to be met before continuing the execution of asynchronous code.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```javascript\nlet condition = false;\n\nsetTimeout(() => {\n  condition = true;\n}, 3000);\n\nasync function waitForCondition() {\n  console.log(\"Waiting for condition...\");\n  await forTrue(() => condition);\n  console.log(\"Condition met!\");\n}\n\nwaitForCondition(); // Output: Waiting for condition... -> (3 second delay) -> Condition met!\n```\n\nIn summary, this file provides two utility functions that help manage asynchronous operations by introducing delays and waiting for specific conditions to be met.
