      "summary": "The `APIRateLimit` class in this code snippet is designed to manage and limit the number of concurrent API calls made by the application. This is useful in situations where the API being called has a rate limit or when the application needs to control the number of simultaneous requests to avoid overloading the server.\n\nThe class has a constructor that takes an optional `maxConcurrentCalls` parameter, which defaults to 50. This parameter determines the maximum number of API calls that can be made concurrently.\n\nThe main method of this class is `callApi<T>(apiFunction: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T>`. This method takes a function `apiFunction` that returns a promise and wraps it in a rate-limited execution. The method returns a promise that resolves with the result of the API call or rejects with an error if the call fails.\n\nWhen `callApi` is called, it adds the `executeCall` function to the `queue`. The `executeCall` function is responsible for executing the API call, resolving or rejecting the promise, and managing the `inProgress` counter. After adding the `executeCall` function to the queue, the code checks if there are available slots for concurrent calls by comparing `inProgress` with `maxConcurrentCalls`. If there are available slots, it calls the `dequeueAndExecute` method.\n\nThe `dequeueAndExecute` method is responsible for executing the queued API calls while ensuring that the number of concurrent calls does not exceed the `maxConcurrentCalls` limit. It dequeues the next API call from the queue and executes it if there are available slots for concurrent calls.\n\nHere's an example of how this class can be used in the larger project:\n\n```javascript\nconst apiRateLimiter = new APIRateLimit(10); // Limit to 10 concurrent calls\n\nasync function fetchData(id) {\n  // Simulate an API call\n  return new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(() => resolve(`Data for ${id}`), 1000));\n}\n\nasync function getData(id) {\n  return apiRateLimiter.callApi(() => fetchData(id));\n}\n\n// Usage\ngetData(1).then(console.log); // Fetches data for ID 1, rate-limited\n```\n\nIn this example, the `APIRateLimit` class is used to limit the number of concurrent calls to the `fetchData` function, which simulates an API call.",
      "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of the `APIRateLimit` class?**\n\n   The `APIRateLimit` class is designed to manage and limit the number of concurrent API calls to a specified maximum, preventing the application from overwhelming the API with too many requests at once.\n\n2. **How does the `callApi` method work and what is its return type?**\n\n   The `callApi` method takes an `apiFunction` as an argument, which is a function that returns a Promise. It adds the API call to a queue and manages the execution of queued calls based on the available slots for concurrent calls. The method returns a Promise of type `T`, where `T` is the expected return type of the `apiFunction`.\n\n3. **How does the `dequeueAndExecute` method work?**\n\n   The `dequeueAndExecute` method is responsible for executing the queued API calls. It checks if there are any calls in the queue and if there are available slots for concurrent calls. If both conditions are met, it dequeues the next call from the queue and executes it. This method is called whenever a new API call is added to the queue or when an in-progress call is completed."

The main purpose of these functions is to generate file names and GitHub URLs for files and folders.\n\n1. `getFileName(input: string, delimiter = '.', extension = '.md'): string`: This function takes an input string, an optional delimiter (default is '.'), and an optional extension (default is '.md'). It returns a new file name with the given extension. If the delimiter is not found in the input string, the function appends the extension to the input string. If the delimiter is found, the function replaces the part after the last delimiter with the extension. For example:\n\n   ```javascript\n   getFileName(\"example.txt\"); // returns \"example.md\"\n   getFileName(\"example\"); // returns \"example.md\"\n   ```\n\n2. `githubFileUrl(githubRoot: string, inputRoot: string, filePath: string, linkHosted: boolean): string`: This function generates a GitHub URL for a file. It takes the GitHub root URL, the input root path, the file path, and a boolean flag `linkHosted`. If `linkHosted` is true, the function returns a URL pointing to the hosted version of the file. If `linkHosted` is false, the function returns a URL pointing to the file in the GitHub repository. For example:\n\n   ```javascript\n   githubFileUrl(\"https://github.com/user/repo\", \"/input\", \"/input/example.md\", true); // returns \"https://github.com/user/repo/example.md\"\n   githubFileUrl(\"https://github.com/user/repo\", \"/input\", \"/input/example.md\", false); // returns \"https://github.com/user/repo/blob/master/example.md\"\n   ```\n\n3. `githubFolderUrl(githubRoot: string, inputRoot: string, folderPath: string, linkHosted: boolean): string`: This function is similar to `githubFileUrl`, but it generates a GitHub URL for a folder instead of a file. If `linkHosted` is true, the function returns a URL pointing to the hosted version of the folder. If `linkHosted` is false, the function returns a URL pointing to the folder in the GitHub repository. For example:\n\n   ```javascript\n   githubFolderUrl(\"https://github.com/user/repo\", \"/input\", \"/input/folder\", true); // returns \"https://github.com/user/repo/folder\"\n   githubFolderUrl(\"https://github.com/user/repo\", \"/input\", \"/input/folder\", false); // returns \"https://github.com/user/repo/tree/master/folder\"\n   ```\n\nThese utility functions can be used in the autodoc project to generate file names and URLs for documentation files and folders, making it easier to manage and navigate the documentation structure.",
      "questions": "1. **What does the `getFileName` function do?**\n\n   The `getFileName` function takes an input string, an optional delimiter (default is '.'), and an optional extension (default is '.md'). It returns the input string with the specified extension, replacing the part after the last occurrence of the delimiter if it exists.\n\n2. **What is the purpose of the `githubFileUrl` and `githubFolderUrl` functions?**\n\n   Both `githubFileUrl` and `githubFolderUrl` functions are used to generate URLs for files and folders, respectively, in a GitHub repository. They take a `githubRoot`, `inputRoot`, a `filePath` or `folderPath`, and a `linkHosted` boolean flag. If `linkHosted` is true, the generated URL will point to the hosted version of the file or folder; otherwise, it will point to the file or folder in the GitHub repository.\n\n3. **Why is the `inputRoot.length - 1` used in the `substring` method for both `githubFileUrl` and `githubFolderUrl` functions?**\n\n   The `inputRoot.length - 1` is used to remove the `inputRoot` part from the `filePath` or `folderPath` when generating the final URL. This ensures that the generated URL only contains the relevant path relative to the GitHub repository root."

It imports the `OpenAIChat` class from the `langchain/llms` module and the `LLMModelDetails` and `LLMModels` types from the `../../types.js` file.\n\nThe `models` object contains three LLMs: GPT3, GPT4, and GPT432k. Each model has a set of properties, such as `name`, `inputCostPer1KTokens`, `outputCostPer1KTokens`, `maxLength`, and an instance of `OpenAIChat` with specific configurations.

      "url": "https://github.com/context-labs/autodoc/src/cli/utils/WaitUtil.ts",
      "summary": "The code in this file provides two utility functions, `wait` and `forTrue`, which are designed to help manage asynchronous operations in the larger project. Both functions return a `Promise`, which is a JavaScript object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.\n\n### wait function\n\nThe `wait` function takes two arguments: `timeoutMs`, which is the number of milliseconds to wait before resolving the promise, and `value`, which is an optional value to be returned when the promise resolves. The function creates a new `Promise` and uses `setTimeout` to resolve it with the given `value` after the specified `timeoutMs` has passed.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```javascript\n// Wait for 2 seconds and then log \"Hello, world!\"\nwait(2000, \"Hello, world!\").then(console.log);\n```\n\n### forTrue function\n\nThe `forTrue` function takes a single argument, `fn`, which is a function that returns a boolean value. The purpose of this function is to repeatedly check if the given function `fn` returns `true`. If it does, the promise resolves with `true`. If the function does not return `true` after 200 checks, the promise is rejected.\n\nThe function uses `setInterval` to repeatedly call the given function `fn` every 50 milliseconds. If `fn` returns `true`, the interval is cleared, and the promise is resolved. If the function has been called 200 times without returning `true`, the promise is rejected.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```javascript\n// Check if a certain element is visible on the page\nconst isElementVisible = () => document.querySelector(\"#my-element\").offsetParent !== null;\n\n// Wait for the element to become visible, then log \"Element is visible!\"\nforTrue(isElementVisible).then(() => console.log(\"Element is visible!\"));\n```\n\nIn summary, these utility functions help manage asynchronous operations by providing a way to wait for a certain amount of time or for a specific condition to be met. They can be used in various parts of the larger project to handle timing and conditional logic in an asynchronous manner.",
      "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of the `wait` function?**\n\n   The `wait` function is an asynchronous utility function that resolves a promise after a specified timeout in milliseconds. It can be used to introduce a delay in the execution of asynchronous code.\n\n2. **How does the `forTrue` function work and what is its use case?**\n\n   The `forTrue` function takes a function `fn` as an argument, which returns a boolean value. It repeatedly checks the result of `fn` every 50 milliseconds until it returns `true` or the maximum number of checks (200) is reached. This function can be used to wait for a specific condition to be met before proceeding with the execution of asynchronous code.\n\n3. **Is there any error handling or customization for the `forTrue` function, such as customizing the interval or maximum number of checks?**\n\n   Currently, there is no error handling or customization options for the `forTrue` function. The interval is hardcoded to 50 milliseconds, and the maximum number of checks is hardcoded to 200. To add customization, additional parameters could be added to the function signature and used in the implementation."

If not, it logs an error message and returns. It then defines a helper function `shouldIgnore` that checks if a given file or folder should be ignored based on the `ignore` patterns.\n\nThe main logic of the function is implemented in the `dfs` (depth-first search) function, which recursively traverses the file system. It reads the contents of the current folder, filters out ignored files and folders, and processes them accordingly. If an entry is a directory, it calls `dfs` recursively and then calls the `processFolder` callback if provided.
