  "summary": "The `convertJsonToMarkdown` function in this code is responsible for converting JSON files containing documentation information into Markdown files. This function is part of the larger Autodoc project, which aims to automate the process of generating documentation for code repositories.\n\nThe function takes an `AutodocRepoConfig` object as input, which contains various configuration options such as the project name, input and output directories, and other settings related to the documentation generation process.\n\nThe code first counts the number of files in the project by traversing the file system using the `traverseFileSystem` utility function. This is done to provide a progress update to the user via the `updateSpinnerText` function.\n\nNext, the `processFile` function is defined, which is responsible for reading the content of each JSON file, parsing it, and converting it into a Markdown format. The function checks if the file has a summary, and if so, it generates the Markdown content with a link to the code on GitHub, the summary, and any questions if present. The output Markdown file is then saved in the specified output directory.\n\nFinally, the `traverseFileSystem` function is called again, this time with the `processFile` function as an argument. This allows the code to process each JSON file in the project and convert it into a Markdown file. Once the process is complete, a success message is displayed to the user using the `spinnerSuccess` function.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```javascript\nconvertJsonToMarkdown({\n  name: \"myProject\",\n  root: \"./input\",\n  output: \"./output\",\n  filePrompt: true,\n  folderPrompt: true,\n  contentType: \"code\",\n  targetAudience: \"developers\",\n  linkHosted: \"https://github.com/user/myProject\",\n});\n```\n\nThis will convert all JSON files in the `./input` directory into Markdown files and save them in the `./output` directory.",
  "questions": "1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `convertJsonToMarkdown` function and what are the expected inputs?\n   **Answer:** The `convertJsonToMarkdown` function is used to convert JSON files to Markdown files for each code file in the project. It takes an `AutodocRepoConfig` object as input, which contains various properties like projectName, root, output, filePrompt, folderPrompt, contentType, targetAudience, and linkHosted.\n\n2. **Question:** How does the `traverseFileSystem` function work and what is its role in this code?\n   **Answer:** The `traverseFileSystem` function is a utility function that recursively traverses the file system, starting from the inputPath, and processes each file using the provided `processFile` function. In this code, it is used twice: first to count the number of files in the project, and then to create Markdown files for each code file in the project.\n\n3. **Question:** How are the output directories and Markdown files created, and what is the structure of the generated Markdown content?\n   **Answer:** The output directories are created using the `fs.mkdir` function with the `recursive: true` option. The Markdown files are created using the `fs.writeFile` function. The structure of the generated Markdown content includes a link to view the code on GitHub, the summary, and optionally, a list of questions if they exist.",
