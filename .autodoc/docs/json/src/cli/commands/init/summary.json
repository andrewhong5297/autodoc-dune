      "questions": "1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `makeConfigTemplate` function and what does it return?\n   **Answer:** The `makeConfigTemplate` function is used to create a default configuration object for the Autodoc project. It takes an optional `config` parameter of type `AutodocRepoConfig` and returns a new `AutodocRepoConfig` object with default values for each property, using the provided `config` values if available.\n\n2. **Question:** How does the `init` function work and what does it do with the user's input?\n   **Answer:** The `init` function is an asynchronous function that initializes the Autodoc configuration by prompting the user for input using the `inquirer` package. It takes an optional `config` parameter of type `AutodocRepoConfig` and uses it as the default values for the prompts. After collecting the user's input, it creates a new configuration object using the `makeConfigTemplate` function and writes it to a file named `autodoc.config.json`.\n\n3. **Question:** What are the different LLM models available in the `llms` prompt and how are they used in the configuration?\n   **Answer:** The `llms` prompt provides three choices for the user to select the LLM models they have access to: GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 8K (Early Access), and GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4 8K (Early Access), and GPT-4 32K (Early Access). The selected LLM models are stored in the `llms` property of the `AutodocRepoConfig` object, which can be used later in the project to determine which models to use for generating documentation."
