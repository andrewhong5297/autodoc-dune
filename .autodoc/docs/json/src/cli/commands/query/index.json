  "summary": "This code defines a chatbot interface for the Autodoc project, which allows users to ask questions related to a specific codebase and receive answers in a conversational manner. The chatbot uses a combination of the `inquirer` library for user input, `marked` and `marked-terminal` for rendering Markdown output, and the `langchain` library for handling natural language processing tasks.\n\nThe `query` function is the main entry point for the chatbot. It takes two arguments: an `AutodocRepoConfig` object containing information about the code repository, and an `AutodocUserConfig` object containing user-specific settings. The function initializes a vector store using the `HNSWLib` and `OpenAIEmbeddings` classes, and creates a chat chain using the `makeChain` function.\n\nThe chatbot interface is displayed using the `displayWelcomeMessage` function, which prints a welcome message to the console. The `getQuestion` function is used to prompt the user for a question using the `inquirer` library. The chatbot then enters a loop, where it processes the user's question, generates a response using the chat chain, and displays the response as Markdown in the terminal.\n\nIf an error occurs during the processing of a question, the chatbot will display an error message and continue to prompt the user for a new question. The loop continues until the user types 'exit', at which point the chatbot terminates.\n\nHere's an example of how the `query` function might be used:\n\n```javascript\nimport { query } from './autodoc';\n\nconst repoConfig = {\n  name: 'MyProject',\n  repositoryUrl: 'https://github.com/user/myproject',\n  output: 'path/to/output',\n  contentType: 'code',\n  chatPrompt: 'Ask me anything about MyProject',\n  targetAudience: 'developers',\n};\n\nconst userConfig = {\n  llms: 'path/to/llms',\n};\n\nquery(repoConfig, userConfig);\n```\n\nThis example would initialize the chatbot with the specified repository and user configurations, and start the chatbot interface for the user to ask questions about the \"MyProject\" codebase.",
  "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of the `query` function in this code?**\n\n   The `query` function is responsible for handling user interactions with the chatbot. It takes in an AutodocRepoConfig object and an AutodocUserConfig object, sets up the necessary data structures, and then enters a loop where it prompts the user for questions, processes them, and displays the results.\n\n2. **How does the code handle rendering Markdown text in the terminal?**\n\n   The code uses the `marked` library along with a custom `TerminalRenderer` to render Markdown text in the terminal. The `marked` library is configured with the custom renderer using `marked.setOptions({ renderer: new TerminalRenderer() });`.\n\n3. **What is the purpose of the `chatHistory` variable and how is it used?**\n\n   The `chatHistory` variable is an array that stores the history of questions and answers in the chat session. It is used to keep track of the conversation between the user and the chatbot. When a new question is asked, the chat history is passed to the `chain.call()` function, and the new question and its corresponding answer are added to the `chatHistory` array.",
