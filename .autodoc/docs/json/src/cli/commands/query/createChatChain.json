  "summary": "This code defines a function `makeChain` that creates a chatbot for answering questions about a software project called `projectName`. The chatbot is trained on the content of the project, which is located at `repositoryUrl`. The content type of the project is specified by the `contentType` parameter. The chatbot is designed to provide conversational answers with hyperlinks back to GitHub, including code examples and links to the examples where appropriate. The target audience for the chatbot is specified by the `targetAudience` parameter.\n\nThe `makeChain` function takes several parameters:\n\n- `projectName`: The name of the software project.\n- `repositoryUrl`: The URL of the project's repository.\n- `contentType`: The type of content the chatbot is trained on.\n- `chatPrompt`: Additional instructions for answering questions about the content type.\n- `targetAudience`: The intended audience for the chatbot's answers.\n- `vectorstore`: An instance of HNSWLib for efficient nearest neighbor search.\n- `llms`: An array of LLMModels, which are language models used for generating answers.\n- `onTokenStream`: An optional callback function that is called when a new token is generated by the language model.\n\nThe `makeChain` function first creates a question generator using the `LLMChain` class. This generator is responsible for rephrasing follow-up questions to be standalone questions. It uses the `CONDENSE_PROMPT` template, which is defined at the beginning of the code.\n\nNext, the function creates a `QA_PROMPT` template using the `makeQAPrompt` function. This template is used to generate answers to the questions in a conversational manner, with hyperlinks back to GitHub and code examples where appropriate.\n\nFinally, the function creates and returns a new instance of the `ChatVectorDBQAChain` class, which combines the question generator and the document chain to create a chatbot that can answer questions about the software project. The chatbot uses the `vectorstore` for efficient nearest neighbor search and the `llms` language models for generating answers. If the `onTokenStream` callback is provided, it will be called when a new token is generated by the language model.",
  "questions": "1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `makeChain` function and what are its input parameters?\n\n   **Answer:** The `makeChain` function is used to create a `ChatVectorDBQAChain` instance, which is responsible for generating questions and answers based on the given input parameters. The input parameters include `projectName`, `repositoryUrl`, `contentType`, `chatPrompt`, `targetAudience`, `vectorstore`, `llms`, and an optional `onTokenStream` function.\n\n2. **Question:** What are the roles of `CONDENSE_PROMPT` and `QA_PROMPT` in this code?\n\n   **Answer:** `CONDENSE_PROMPT` is a template for generating standalone questions from a given chat history and follow-up question. `QA_PROMPT` is a template for generating conversational answers with hyperlinks to GitHub, based on the provided context and question. Both templates are used in the `LLMChain` and `loadQAChain` instances, respectively.\n\n3. **Question:** How does the `onTokenStream` function work and when is it used?\n\n   **Answer:** The `onTokenStream` function is an optional callback that can be provided to the `makeChain` function. It is used to handle the streaming of tokens generated by the OpenAIChat instance. If provided, it will be called with each new token generated during the chat process.",
