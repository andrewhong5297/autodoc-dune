This is done in two main steps: counting the number of files in the project and creating Markdown files for each code file in the project.\n\nFirst, the function uses the `traverseFileSystem` utility to count the number of files in the project. It takes an `AutodocRepoConfig` object as input, which contains information about the project, such as its name, root directory, output directory, and other configuration options. The `traverseFileSystem` utility is called with a `processFile` function that increments the `files` counter for each file encountered.\n\n```javascript\nawait traverseFileSystem({\n  inputPath: inputRoot,\n  projectName,\n  processFile: () => {\n    files++;\n    return Promise.resolve();\n  },\n  ignore: [],\n  filePrompt,\n  folderPrompt,\n  contentType,\n  targetAudience,\n  linkHosted,\n});\n```\n\nNext, the function defines another `processFile` function that reads the content of each JSON file, converts it to a Markdown format, and writes the output to a new Markdown file in the specified output directory. It first checks if the content exists, and if not, it returns early. It then creates the output directory if it doesn't exist, and parses the JSON content into either a `FolderSummary` or a `FileSummary` object, depending on the file name.\n\nThe function then constructs the Markdown content by including a link to the code on GitHub, the summary, and any questions if they exist. Finally, it writes the Markdown content to the output file with the `.md` extension.\n\n```javascript\nconst outputPath = getFileName(markdownFilePath, '.', '.md');\nawait fs.writeFile(outputPath, markdown, 'utf-8');\n```\n\nThe `convertJsonToMarkdown` function is then called again with the new `processFile` function to create the Markdown files for each code file in the project.\n\n```javascript\nawait traverseFileSystem({\n  inputPath: inputRoot,\n  projectName,\n  processFile,\n  ignore: [],\n  filePrompt,\n  folderPrompt,\n  contentType,\n  targetAudience,\n  linkHosted,\n});\n```\n\nIn summary, this code is responsible for converting JSON files containing documentation information into Markdown files, which can be used in the larger Autodoc project to generate documentation for code repositories.",

It then defines several helper functions, such as `callLLM` for making API calls, `isModel` for checking if a given model is valid, `processFile` for processing individual files, and `processFolder` for processing folders.\n\nThe `processFile` function reads the content of a file, generates prompts for summaries and questions using the `createCodeFileSummary` and `createCodeQuestions` functions, and selects the best language model to use based on the token length of the prompts. It then calls the language model API to generate the summaries and questions, and saves the results as JSON files in the output directory.\n\nThe `processFolder` function reads the contents of a folder, filters out ignored files, and processes each file and subfolder within the folder. It then generates a summary prompt using the `folderSummaryPrompt` function and calls the language model API to generate a summary for the folder. The folder summary, along with the summaries and questions of its files and subfolders, is saved as a JSON file in the output directory.\n\nThe main part of the `processRepository` function first counts the number of files and folders in the input directory using the `filesAndFolders` function.

The chatbot is built using the `ChatVectorDBQAChain` class, which combines two separate language models: a question generator and a document chain.\n\nThe question generator is an instance of the `LLMChain` class, which uses the OpenAIChat API to generate standalone questions based on a given conversation history. The `CONDENSE_PROMPT` template is used to format the input for the language model.\n\nThe document chain is created using the `loadQAChain` function, which takes an instance of the OpenAIChat API and a prompt template as input. The `makeQAPrompt` function generates this template, which instructs the language model to provide a conversational answer with hyperlinks to the project's GitHub repository. The answer should be tailored to the target audience and include code examples when appropriate.\n\nThe `makeChain` function takes the following parameters:\n\n- `projectName`: The name of the software project.\n- `repositoryUrl`: The URL of the project's GitHub repository.\n- `contentType`: The type of content the chatbot is trained on (e.g., code, documentation).\n- `chatPrompt`: Additional instructions for answering questions about the content.\n- `targetAudience`: The intended audience for the chatbot's answers (e.g., developers, users).\n- `vectorstore`: An instance of the `HNSWLib` class for storing and searching vectors.\n- `llms`: An array of language models (e.g., GPT-3, GPT-4).\n- `onTokenStream`: An optional callback function to handle streaming tokens.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```javascript\nconst chatbot = makeChain(\n  \"autodoc\",\n  \"https://github.com/autodoc/autodoc\",\n  \"code\",\n  \"\",\n  \"developer\",\n  vectorstore,\n  [gpt3, gpt4],\n  (token) => console.log(token)\n);\n```\n\nThis creates a chatbot that can answer questions about the \"autodoc\" project, using the provided language models and vector store.",
          "questions": "1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `makeChain` function and what are its input parameters?\n   **Answer:** The `makeChain` function is used to create a new `ChatVectorDBQAChain` instance, which is responsible for generating questions and answers based on the given input parameters. The input parameters include `projectName`, `repositoryUrl`, `contentType`, `chatPrompt`, `targetAudience`, `vectorstore`, `llms`, and an optional `onTokenStream` callback function.\n\n2. **Question:** What are the roles of `CONDENSE_PROMPT` and `QA_PROMPT` in the code?\n   **Answer:** `CONDENSE_PROMPT` is a template for generating a standalone question from a given chat history and follow-up input. `QA_PROMPT` is a template for generating a conversational answer with hyperlinks back to GitHub, based on the given context and question. Both templates are used in the `LLMChain` and `loadQAChain` instances, respectively.\n\n3. **Question:** How does the `onTokenStream` callback function work and when is it used?\n   **Answer:** The `onTokenStream` callback function is an optional parameter in the `makeChain` function. It is used to handle the streaming of tokens generated by the OpenAIChat instance. If provided, it will be called with each new token generated during the chat process, allowing developers to handle or process the tokens in real-time."
