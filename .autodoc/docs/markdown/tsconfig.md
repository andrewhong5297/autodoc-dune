This code is a configuration file for the TypeScript compiler in a project. The purpose of this configuration is to define various options and settings that the TypeScript compiler should use when transpiling TypeScript code into JavaScript. This is important for ensuring that the compiled output is consistent and compatible with the intended runtime environment.

Here's a brief explanation of the key options set in this configuration:

- `"rootDir": "src"`: Specifies the root directory containing the TypeScript source files. This tells the compiler where to look for the input files.
- `"outDir": "dist"`: Specifies the output directory for the compiled JavaScript files. This is where the transpiled code will be saved.
- `"strict": true`: Enables strict type checking, which enforces stronger type safety and helps catch potential issues during development.
- `"target": "es2020"`: Sets the target ECMAScript version for the compiled output. In this case, the output will be compatible with ECMAScript 2020 (ES11) features.
- `"module": "ES2020"`: Specifies the module system to use in the compiled output. This setting is aligned with the target ECMAScript version.
- `"sourceMap": true`: Generates source map files alongside the compiled output. This helps with debugging by mapping the compiled code back to the original TypeScript source.
- `"esModuleInterop": true` and `"allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true`: These options enable better compatibility with different module systems and allow for more flexible import statements.
- `"moduleResolution": "node"`: Sets the module resolution strategy to Node.js-style, which is the most common approach for resolving module imports in JavaScript projects.
- `"declaration": true`: Generates TypeScript declaration files (`.d.ts`) alongside the compiled output. These files provide type information for the compiled code, which can be useful for other TypeScript projects that depend on this one.
- `"skipLibCheck": true`: Skips type checking of declaration files, which can speed up the compilation process.

In the larger project, this configuration file ensures that the TypeScript compiler produces consistent and compatible JavaScript output, making it easier to integrate the compiled code with other parts of the project or with external dependencies.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `rootDir` and `outDir` options in the configuration?**

   The `rootDir` option specifies the root folder of the source files, while the `outDir` option specifies the output directory for the compiled files.

2. **What does the `strict` option do in the configuration?**

   The `strict` option enables a set of strict type-checking options in the TypeScript compiler, ensuring a higher level of type safety in the code.

3. **What is the significance of the `target` and `module` options in the configuration?**

   The `target` option sets the ECMAScript target version for the compiled JavaScript output, while the `module` option specifies the module system to be used in the generated code. In this case, both are set to "es2020", indicating that the output will be ECMAScript 2020 compliant.
