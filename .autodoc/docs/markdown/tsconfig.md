The code provided is a configuration file for the TypeScript compiler in a project. It specifies various options that control how the TypeScript compiler should process the source code and generate the output JavaScript files. This configuration file is typically named `tsconfig.json` and is placed at the root of a TypeScript project.

The `compilerOptions` object contains several key-value pairs that define the behavior of the TypeScript compiler:

- `rootDir`: Specifies the root directory of the source files. In this case, it is set to "src", meaning that the source files are located in the "src" folder.
- `outDir`: Specifies the output directory for the compiled JavaScript files. In this case, it is set to "dist", meaning that the compiled files will be placed in the "dist" folder.
- `strict`: Enables strict type checking, which helps catch potential issues in the code.
- `target`: Specifies the ECMAScript target version for the output JavaScript files. In this case, it is set to "es2020", meaning that the output files will be compatible with ECMAScript 2020 features.
- `module`: Specifies the module system to be used. In this case, it is set to "ES2020", meaning that the output files will use the ECMAScript 2020 module system.
- `sourceMap`: Generates source map files, which help in debugging the compiled code by mapping it back to the original TypeScript source files.
- `esModuleInterop`: Enables compatibility with ECMAScript modules for importing CommonJS modules.
- `moduleResolution`: Specifies the module resolution strategy. In this case, it is set to "node", meaning that the Node.js module resolution algorithm will be used.
- `allowSyntheticDefaultImports`: Allows default imports from modules with no default export.
- `declaration`: Generates TypeScript declaration files (`.d.ts`) alongside the compiled JavaScript files, which can be useful for other projects that depend on this one.
- `skipLibCheck`: Skips type checking of declaration files, which can speed up the compilation process.

Overall, this configuration file helps ensure that the TypeScript compiler processes the source code according to the specified options, resulting in compiled JavaScript files that are compatible with the desired ECMAScript version and module system, while also providing useful features like source maps and strict type checking.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `rootDir` and `outDir` options in the configuration?**

   The `rootDir` option specifies the root directory of the input files, while the `outDir` option specifies the output directory for the compiled files.

2. **What does the `strict` option do in the configuration?**

   The `strict` option enables a wide range of type checking behavior that results in stronger guarantees of program correctness.

3. **What is the significance of the `target` and `module` options in the configuration?**

   The `target` option specifies the ECMAScript target version for the output code, and the `module` option specifies the module system used in the output code. In this case, both are set to "es2020", which means the output code will be compatible with ECMAScript 2020 features and module system.
