The code in this file provides two utility functions, `wait` and `forTrue`, which are designed to help manage asynchronous operations in the larger project. Both functions return a `Promise`, making them suitable for use with `async/await` syntax.

### wait

The `wait` function takes two arguments: `timeoutMs`, a number representing the desired waiting time in milliseconds, and an optional `value` that defaults to `null`. It returns a `Promise` that resolves with the provided `value` after the specified `timeoutMs` has elapsed. This function can be used to introduce a delay in the execution of asynchronous code.

Example usage:

```javascript
async function delayedEcho() {
  console.log("Start");
  await wait(1000, "Hello");
  console.log("End");
}

delayedEcho(); // Output: Start -> (1 second delay) -> End
```

### forTrue

The `forTrue` function takes a single argument, `fn`, which is a function that returns a boolean value. It returns a `Promise` that resolves with `true` when the provided function `fn` returns `true`. The function `fn` is checked every 50 milliseconds, up to a maximum of 200 times (i.e., 10 seconds). If `fn` does not return `true` within this time, the `Promise` is rejected.

This function can be used to wait for a specific condition to be met before continuing the execution of asynchronous code.

Example usage:

```javascript
let condition = false;

setTimeout(() => {
  condition = true;
}, 3000);

async function waitForCondition() {
  console.log("Waiting for condition...");
  await forTrue(() => condition);
  console.log("Condition met!");
}

waitForCondition(); // Output: Waiting for condition... -> (3 second delay) -> Condition met!
```

In summary, this file provides two utility functions that help manage asynchronous operations by introducing delays and waiting for specific conditions to be met. These functions can be used in the larger project to control the flow of asynchronous code execution.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `wait` function?**

   The `wait` function is an asynchronous utility function that resolves a promise after a specified timeout in milliseconds, optionally returning a value when the promise is resolved.

2. **How does the `forTrue` function work?**

   The `forTrue` function takes a function `fn` as an argument, which should return a boolean value. It checks the result of `fn` every 50 milliseconds and resolves the promise when `fn` returns `true`. If `fn` does not return `true` after 200 attempts, the promise is rejected.

3. **What is the use case for the `forTrue` function?**

   The `forTrue` function can be used to wait for a certain condition to be met before proceeding with the execution of the code. This can be useful in situations where you need to wait for an asynchronous operation to complete or a specific state to be reached before continuing.
