The code in this file provides two utility functions, `wait` and `forTrue`, which are designed to help manage asynchronous operations in the larger project. Both functions return a `Promise`, which is a JavaScript object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

### wait function

The `wait` function takes two arguments: `timeoutMs`, which is the number of milliseconds to wait before resolving the promise, and `value`, which is an optional value to be returned when the promise resolves. The function creates a new `Promise` and uses `setTimeout` to resolve it with the given `value` after the specified `timeoutMs` has passed.

Example usage:

```javascript
// Wait for 2 seconds and then log "Hello, world!"
wait(2000, "Hello, world!").then(console.log);
```

### forTrue function

The `forTrue` function takes a single argument, `fn`, which is a function that returns a boolean value. The purpose of this function is to repeatedly check if the given function `fn` returns `true`. If it does, the promise resolves with `true`. If the function does not return `true` after 200 checks, the promise is rejected.

The function uses `setInterval` to repeatedly call the given function `fn` every 50 milliseconds. If `fn` returns `true`, the interval is cleared, and the promise is resolved. If the function has been called 200 times without returning `true`, the promise is rejected.

Example usage:

```javascript
// Check if a certain element is visible on the page
const isElementVisible = () => document.querySelector("#my-element").offsetParent !== null;

// Wait for the element to become visible, then log "Element is visible!"
forTrue(isElementVisible).then(() => console.log("Element is visible!"));
```

In summary, these utility functions help manage asynchronous operations by providing a way to wait for a certain amount of time or for a specific condition to be met. They can be used in various parts of the larger project to handle timing and conditional logic in an asynchronous manner.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `wait` function?**

   The `wait` function is an asynchronous utility function that resolves a promise after a specified timeout in milliseconds. It can be used to introduce a delay in the execution of asynchronous code.

2. **How does the `forTrue` function work and what is its use case?**

   The `forTrue` function takes a function `fn` as an argument, which returns a boolean value. It repeatedly checks the result of `fn` every 50 milliseconds until it returns `true` or the maximum number of checks (200) is reached. This function can be used to wait for a specific condition to be met before proceeding with the execution of asynchronous code.

3. **Is there any error handling or customization for the `forTrue` function, such as customizing the interval or maximum number of checks?**

   Currently, there is no error handling or customization options for the `forTrue` function. The interval is hardcoded to 50 milliseconds, and the maximum number of checks is hardcoded to 200. To add customization, additional parameters could be added to the function signature and used in the implementation.
