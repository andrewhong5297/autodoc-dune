This code is responsible for managing a spinner, which is a visual element that indicates a process is running in the background. The spinner is created using the `ora` library, which provides a simple and customizable way to create spinners for command-line interfaces.

The code starts by importing the `ora` library and creating a singleton spinner instance with the 'dots' style. This ensures that there will only be one spinner active at any given time.

There are several functions exported by this module to interact with the spinner:

1. `updateSpinnerText(message: string)`: This function updates the spinner's text with the provided message. If the spinner is already spinning, it simply updates the text; otherwise, it starts the spinner with the new message.

   Example usage:
   ```javascript
   updateSpinnerText('Loading data...');
   ```

2. `stopSpinner()`: This function stops the spinner if it is currently spinning.

   Example usage:
   ```javascript
   stopSpinner();
   ```

3. `spinnerError(message?: string)`: This function stops the spinner and marks it as failed with an optional error message. It only takes effect if the spinner is currently spinning.

   Example usage:
   ```javascript
   spinnerError('Failed to load data');
   ```

4. `spinnerSuccess(message?: string)`: This function stops the spinner and marks it as successful with an optional success message. It only takes effect if the spinner is currently spinning.

   Example usage:
   ```javascript
   spinnerSuccess('Data loaded successfully');
   ```

5. `spinnerInfo(message: string)`: This function displays an informational message without affecting the spinner's state.

   Example usage:
   ```javascript
   spinnerInfo('Connecting to server...');
   ```

In the larger project, this module can be used to provide visual feedback to users when a background process is running, such as loading data, connecting to a server, or performing a complex calculation. By using the exported functions, developers can easily update the spinner's text, stop it, or change its state to indicate success, failure, or display informational messages.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `ora` package in this code?**

   The `ora` package is used to create a spinner in the command line interface, providing a visual indication of a running process. In this code, it is used to create a singleton spinner with the 'dots' style.

2. **How does the `updateSpinnerText` function work?**

   The `updateSpinnerText` function takes a message as an input and updates the spinner's text with the given message. If the spinner is already spinning, it updates the text directly; otherwise, it starts the spinner with the new message.

3. **What are the differences between `spinnerError`, `spinnerSuccess`, and `spinnerInfo` functions?**

   These functions are used to update the spinner's state and message based on the outcome of a process. `spinnerError` is called when there is an error, and it stops the spinner with a failure message. `spinnerSuccess` is called when the process is successful, and it stops the spinner with a success message. `spinnerInfo` is used to display an informational message without stopping the spinner.
