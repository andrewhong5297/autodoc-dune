The code in this folder is responsible for processing a given repository and generating documentation in JSON, Markdown, and vector formats. It consists of several functions and utilities that work together to automate the documentation generation process.

The main function, `index`, takes an `AutodocRepoConfig` object as input, which contains various configuration options for processing the repository. It performs three main tasks:

1. **Process the repository**: It calls the `processRepository` function to traverse the repository, generate summaries and questions for code files and folders using the LLMS (Language Learning Management System), and create JSON files with the results. These JSON files are stored in the `output/docs/json/` directory.

2. **Create Markdown files**: It uses the `convertJsonToMarkdown` function to convert the generated JSON files into Markdown files. These Markdown files are stored in the `output/docs/markdown/` directory.

3. **Create vector files**: It calls the `createVectorStore` function to create vector files from the generated Markdown files. These vector files are stored in the `output/docs/data/` directory.

Throughout the execution of these tasks, the code provides visual feedback on the progress of the tasks using `updateSpinnerText` and `spinnerSuccess` functions.

Here's an example of how this code might be used:

```javascript
index({
  name: "myProject",
  root: "./input",
  output: "./output",
  filePrompt: true,
  folderPrompt: true,
  contentType: "code",
  targetAudience: "developers",
  linkHosted: "https://github.com/user/myProject",
});
```

This will process the repository located at `./input`, generate documentation in JSON, Markdown, and vector formats, and save the results in the `./output` directory.

The `prompts.ts` file contains utility functions that generate prompts for documentation experts. These functions create markdown formatted strings with specific instructions for the documentation expert, ensuring consistent formatting and instructions across different parts of the project.

In summary, the code in this folder automates the process of generating documentation for a given repository based on the provided configuration options. The generated documentation can be used for various purposes, such as displaying it on a website or analyzing the content for specific insights.
