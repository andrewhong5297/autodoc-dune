This code defines a chatbot interface for the Autodoc project, which allows users to ask questions related to a specific codebase and receive answers in a conversational manner. The chatbot uses a language model to generate responses based on the user's input and the codebase documentation.

The code starts by importing necessary libraries and setting up the `marked` library with a custom terminal renderer for displaying Markdown content. It then defines a `chatHistory` array to store the conversation history between the user and the chatbot.

The `displayWelcomeMessage` function is used to display a welcome message to the user when they start the chatbot. The `clearScreenAndMoveCursorToTop` function clears the terminal screen and moves the cursor to the top.

The main function, `query`, takes two arguments: `AutodocRepoConfig` and `AutodocUserConfig`. It initializes the `vectorStore` by loading pre-trained embeddings and creates a `chain` object using the `makeChain` function. This chain object is responsible for generating responses based on the user's input.

The `getQuestion` function uses the `inquirer` library to prompt the user for a question. The main loop of the chatbot starts by getting the user's question and continues until the user types 'exit'. Inside the loop, the code updates the spinner text to 'Thinking...' and calls the `chain` object with the user's question and chat history. The response is then displayed in Markdown format using the `marked` library.

If an error occurs during the process, the chatbot displays an error message and prompts the user for another question.

Example usage:

```javascript
query(repoConfig, userConfig);
```

This chatbot interface can be used in the larger Autodoc project to help users navigate and understand the codebase more efficiently by providing a conversational interface for asking questions and receiving answers.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `query` function and what are its input parameters?**

   The `query` function is used to interact with the chatbot, taking user input and providing responses based on the given codebase. It takes two input parameters: an `AutodocRepoConfig` object containing information about the repository, and an `AutodocUserConfig` object containing user-specific configuration.

2. **How does the `vectorStore` work and what is its role in the code?**

   The `vectorStore` is an instance of HNSWLib loaded with data from the specified output directory and using OpenAIEmbeddings. It is used to store and retrieve vector representations of the codebase, which are then used by the `makeChain` function to generate responses to user questions.

3. **How does the chat history work and what is its purpose?**

   The `chatHistory` is an array of string pairs, where each pair represents a user question and the corresponding chatbot response. It is used to store the conversation history between the user and the chatbot, allowing the chatbot to provide context-aware responses based on previous interactions.
